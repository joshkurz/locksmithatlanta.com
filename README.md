# The WoodStock Locksmith Open Source Repo

## About

Open Sesame is The Woodstock Locksmith. We have proudly been taking care of the area for over 8 years. This repo is where we host our website files. We care about open source. We know this is not a very reusable site, but still would like to give props to Pixyll for the theme and for the awesome blog posts on how to get started.
